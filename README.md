Our team comprises three members: Fabrice, Aynur, and Egemen. It is a diverse group with individuals from distinct backgrounds collaborating on a project called Major-A, inspired by Utopia 2.0. The project involves the development of a website primarily designed for desktop and tablet devices, aimed at providing high school seniors with easy access to information on their potential academic majors.
